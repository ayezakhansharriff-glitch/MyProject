Title: Oracle’s Caves – Text-Based Adventure Game in C

This project is a console-based adventure game written in C. The player wakes up inside ancient caves once ruled by an old civilization called the Arkenites. Their goal is to collect three sacred relics — the Ancient Key, the Oracle’s Tome, and the Seal of Wisdom — in order to unlock the final chamber and meet The Oracle.

The game includes:

Story introduction

Multiple rooms (Left Chamber, Old Library, Puzzle Room, Final Door)

Combat system with enemies

Riddle challenges

Health, sanity, and item management

Rest system to recover HP and sanity

Inventory system using dynamic memory (malloc)

Player stats like strength, intelligence, agility

Structs for player and enemy

The player must explore the chambers, solve puzzles, survive fights, and gather all three relics to access the Oracle’s Chamber. The game ends with a story-based conclusion when the player succeeds.
